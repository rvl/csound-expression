Csound-expression is a Haskell framework for computer music.
With the help of the library we can create our instruments on the fly.
A couple of lines in the interpreter is enough to get the cool sound going
out of your speakers. It can be used for simple daily sound-file processing
or for a full-blown live performances. It's available on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/csound-expression).

Let's look at how we can create computer music with Haskell.

* [Overview of the library](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/appendix/Overview.markdown)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: the library works best within ghci. The real-time sound rendering
function `dac` spawns a child process in the background which may continue
to execute after you stop the main process that runs the programm.
It's not so in vim but it happens in the Sublime Editor and when you
invoke `runhaskell`. So the best is to write you program in the separate
file and then load it in the ghci and invoke the function `main`
(which runs the sound rendering with the function `dac`).

---------------------------------------------------------------------

News
-----------------------------

**The new version 5.3 is out. Support for modern Haskell and Csound, sync with global BPM**

Let's look at the new features.

* The project was updated to compile with new GHC 8.4.x.
    Also it was tested on previous compilers down to 7.8.
    So the CE should compile across 7.8 to 8.4 GHC compilers.

* The library was updated to support latest Csound stable release 6.10.
    There are many new DSP algorithms available with this update.
    Among them there are many great filters like emulation of Korg 35 analog filter,
    or emulation of Roland TB-303 resonant filter, zero-delay feedback filters.
    You can find them at the module `Csound.Air.Filter`.

* Also documentation, examples and tutorial were updated for
    recent changes.

* This release features new effects useful for guitars.
    Like emulation of Roland Space echo (function `tapeEcho` or `magnus`)
    and ambient guitar effect (`ambiEnv`, `ambiGuitar`).
    The Space echo simulates behaviour of magnetic tape delay.
    Ambient guitar detects strike attacks in the audio signal and
    smoothes them down, so that they sound like pads.

* New addition is built in BPM synchronization. User can set global BPM
    with function `setBpm`. Then it's possible to use functions that
    synchronize Hzs (function `syn`) and seconds (function `takt`) to
    global BPM. It's useful to align delay times and LFO rates with
    global BPM. Also module `csound-sampler` was updated to respond
    to changes in global BPM.

* There are some additions to improve usability of the library
    like adding new instances for rendering to Csound files.
    Like rendering functions with arbitrary number of inputs and outputs
    and rendering of functions augmented with UIs.

* New useful functions: `brown` for brownian noise, `resizeGui`
    for scaling GUIs window size.

**The 5.2 is out. Virtual pedalboards, arrays, new OSC, full support for mono synthesizers, patch skins, all GEN-routines are implemented**

**New features:**

* **Complete support for monophonic synthesizers**:

    * The argument of mono synth was updated.

        Previously it was a pair of amplitude and frequency signals.
        But this representation doesn't captures the notion of note retrigger.
        We can not create the mono-synt with sharp attacks.

        Now this is fixed. We can use adsr140 or adsrMonoSynt functions to create
        mono synths with fixed attacks

    * monoSco  - for playing scores with mono-synths

    * monoSched - for playing event streams with mono synt

    * atSco and atSched now work for mono synth too

* **The patch can change the skin**. The Patch type has changed. Know it supports the change in common parameters.
   Right now the ccommon parameters include only Low-pass filter type. But this can be extended in future releases.

   The idea is that we can parametrize the patch with some common arguments so that use can tweak them
   without revriting the algorithm.

   The low-pass filter is a vital tool that defines the character of the synthesizer.
   With recent addition of several modern filter emulators (like Korg (korg_lp), or acid filter diode)
   it's good to be able to quickly switch the filters. We can do it for patches with function

   ~~~haskell
   setFilter :: ResonFilter -> Patch a -> Patch a
   ~~~

* **Family of standard effects was added** (see module `Csound.Air.Fx.FxBox` and the [guide](https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/FxFamily.md)).
  The effects are kindly provided by Iain McCurdy (recoded from his original implementation in Csound).

    The effects have catchy names and are defined on wide variety of types. Let's briefly discuss the naming conventions:

    * `adele` - analog delay

    * `pongy` - ping pong delay

    * `tort`  - distortion

    * `flan`  - flanger

    * `fowler` - Envelope follower

    * `phasy`  - phaser

    * `crusher` - bit-crusher

    * `chory`  - stereo chorus

    * `tremy`  - tremolo

    * `pany`   - panning

    * `revsy`  - reverse playback

  Also there are set of presets that imply the notion of add a bit of effect or add a lot of effect.
    They are suffixed with number from 1 to 5. Like `flan1` or `tort3`. Also if the effect support the
    tone knob (center frequency of LP filter) ter are suffixes `b` for bright color and `m` for muted color.
    For example `tort2m` or `adele2b`.


    The effects are just functions from signals to signals:

  ~~~haskell
  dac $ hall 0.2 $ adele2 0.5 0.25 $ flan2 $ tort1m $ asigs
  ~~~

* **UI widgets for standard effects**.

    Alongside with effects there are functions to create widgets (UI-controls). They have the same naming convention
    only the prefix `ui` is added. For example: `uiTort`, `uiAdele` or `uiHall`. Also there are predefined presets like `uiFlan2` or `uiPhasy3`.
    With presets we put the box in the initial state corresponding to the given preset. But lately we can change it with UI-controls.

    With this feature paired with functions `fxHor`, `fxVer` and `fxGrid` we can easily design our virtual pedalboards.

    It can be used like this:

    ~~~haskell
    > let pedals = fxGrid 2 [uiFlan1, uiTort1, uiAdele2m 0.5 0.3, uiHall 0.25]

    > dac $ fxApply pedals $ (sawSeq [1, 0.5, 0.25] 2) * sqr 220
    ~~~

* **Complete list of GEN routines**. This release adds GEN:

        * 25 bpExps --  Construct functions from segments of exponential curves in breakpoint fashion.,

        * 27 bpLins --  Construct functions from segments of straight lines in breakpoint fashion.

        * wave waveletTab -- Generates a compactly supported wavelet function.

        * farey fareyTab -- Fills a table with the Farey Sequence Fn of the integer n.

        * sone soneTab -- Generate a table with values of the sone function.

        * exp expTab -- rescaleExpTab Generate a table with values on the exp function.

        * tanh tanhTab -- rescaleTanhTab Generate a table with values on the tanh function.

        * 52 readMultichannel -- Creates an interleaved multichannel table from the specified source tables, in the format expected by the ftconv opcode.

        * 41 randDist -- Generates a random list of numerical pairs.

        * 42 rangeDist Generates a random distribution of discrete ranges of values.

        * 40 tabDist -- Generates a random distribution using a distribution histogram.

        * 43 readPvocex -- Loads a PVOCEX file containing a PV analysis.

        * 28 readTrajectoryFile -- Reads a text file which contains a time-tagged trajectory.

        * 24 readNumTab --  Reads numeric values from another allocated function-table and rescales them.

        * 21 dist, uniDist, linDist, triDist, expDist, biexpDist, gaussDist, cauchyDist, pcauchyDist, betaDist, weibullDist, poissonDist -- Generates tables of different random distributions.

        * 18 tabseg -- Writes composite waveforms made up of pre-existing waveforms.

        * 31 mixOnTab -- Mixes any waveform specified in an existing table.

        * 32 mixTabs -- Mixes any waveform, resampled with either FFT or linear interpolation.

        * 30 tabHarmonics -- Generates harmonic partials by analyzing an existing table.

    See the [Csound docs](http://www.csounds.com/manualOLPC/ScoreGenRef.html) for details of what table they produce.
    Also the signatures for windows creating tabs was updated. It became more specific.

* **Global arguments** defined with **Macros**. We can create a Csound `.csd` file in our program
    and after that we can run it on anything which has Csound installed. It's desirable to be able
    to tweak some parameters after rendering or to have some global config arguments.
    In Csound we can do it with macroses. We can use macros name in the code adn then we can change the value of the
    macros with command line flag `--omacro:Name=Value`.

    From now on it's possible to do it with Haskell too. There are functions:

    ~~~haskell
    readMacrosDouble  :: String -> Double -> D
    readMacrosInt     :: String -> Int -> D
    readMacrosString  :: String -> String -> Str
    ~~~

    The first argument is a macro name and the second one is the default value
    which is used if no value is set in the flags.

*  The useful function to **trigger an table based envelope**. It comes in two flavors. One is driven with event stream
    and another with just a signal. It's on when signal is non zero.

    ~~~haskell
    trigTab :: Tab -> Sig -> Sig -> Sig
    trigTab tab duration triggerSignal

    type Tick = Evt Unit

    trigTabEvt :: Tab -> Sig -> Tick -> Sig
    trigTabEvt tab duration triggerSignal
    ~~~

* **New functions for UI widgets**.

    * We can change the relative size of the window. If the widget is too large or too small
        we can rescale it with functions:

        ~~~haskell
        type ScaleFactor = (Double, Double)

        resizeGui :: ScaleFactor -> Gui -> Gui

        resizeSource :: ScaleFactor -> Source a -> Source a
        ~~~

        They change the default minimal sizes for all widgets that are contained within the given widget.

    * Grid layout. We are familiar with functions `ver` and `hor`. With them we can place the widgets vertically or horizontally.
       But now it's also possible to place the widgets on the grid:

       ~~~haskell
       grid :: Int -> [Gui] -> Gui
       ~~~

       The first argument specifies the number of elements in each row.

       There are handy grid functions for combining source-widgets:

       ~~~haskell
       gridLifts :: Int -> ([a] -> b) -> [Source a] -> Source b
       ~~~

       It applies a list based function to a list of value producer widgets and places all widgets on the grid.
       The first argument is the same as with `grid`.

    * UI default sizes are a bit smaller now.

* It compiles on **GHC-7.8** again

* New function `whileRef` for imperative while loops.

    ~~~haskell
    whileRef :: Tuple st => st -> (st -> SE BoolSig) -> (st -> SE st) -> SE ()
    whileRef initState condition body
    ~~~

    It's used in this way. It stores the initial state in the reference (local variable)
    and the it starts to implement the body while the predicate returns true. Notice that
    the body is also updates the state.

* **New functions for OSC** that make it easy to read OSC messages that are interpreted like signals.
    For example we have an OSC-routine for volume control. When message happens we update the value.
    It would be good to be able to just read the signal:

    ~~~haskell
    listenOscVal :: (Tuple a, OscVal a) => OscRef -> String -> a -> SE a
    listenOscVal oscRef address initValue
    ~~~

    There are two useful aliases for this function. They read signals and pairs of signals:

    ~~~haskell
    listenOscSig  :: OscRef -> String -> Sig  -> SE Sig
    listenOscSig2 :: OscRef -> String -> Sig2 -> SE Sig2
    ~~~

* **Adds loopers that preserve attacks when rescaling by tempo**.
    They are based on `temposcal` Csound algorithm.
   The previous loopers were based on the `mincer` algorithm. It uses FFT under the hood which can smooth out the sharp attacks.
   It's undesirable for percussive loops. The `temposcal` adds the feature of preserving attacks.

   See the functions:

   ~~~haskell
   -- | reads stereo files with scaling
   scaleWav ::  Fidelity -> TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sig2

   -- | reads mono files with scaling
   scaleWav1 :: Fidelity -> TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sig
   ~~~

   Also there are presets for scaling the drums or harmonic instruments (they set the appropriate fidelity):

   ~~~haskell
   scaleDrum, scaleHarm :: TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sig2
   ~~~

   The fidelity is the degree of the size of FFT window. The formula for window size: 2 ** (fidelity + 11).

   Also the corresponding functions are added for `csound-sampler`.

   ~~~haskell
   wavScale :: Fidelity -> TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sam
   wavScale1 :: Fidelity -> TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sam

   drumScale, harmScale :: TempoSig -> PitchSig -> String -> Sam
   ~~~

* The type signatures for **echo and pingPong where simplified**. Now they don't use side effects
    and look like pure functions:

    ~~~haskell
    echo :: MaxDelayTime -> Feedback -> Sig -> Sig
    pingPong :: DelayTime -> Feedback -> Balance -> Sig2 -> Sig2
    ~~~

* Type signatures for functions **`randSkip` and `freqOf` where generalized**. Now they use signals for probabilities
   instead of constant numbers. So we can change the probability of skip of the event during performance.

* **New monophonic instruments are added in csound-catalog**: `fmBass1`, `fmBass2`, `dafunkLead` and one polyphonic `celloSynt`.
   Those instrument serve a good example for building monophonic synthesizers with sharp attacks.

Experimental features:

* **Arrays, with all opcodes** and functional traversals. See the guide for details [details](https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/BasicTypesTutorial.md#arrays-arr).

* **Imperative style instruments**.

    With imperative style instruments we can create and invoke the instruments in Csound way.
    we can create an instrument and get it's unique identifier. Than we can schedule a note by that identifier.

    We can create an instrument that produces a sound with function:

    ~~~haskell
    newOutInstr :: (Arg a, Sigs b) => (a -> SE b) -> SE (InstrRef a, b)
    ~~~

    It takes in a body of the instrument and gives back an instrument reference and
    a signal where the output is going to be written. Then we can invoke the notes just
    like we do it in the Csound with function `scheduleEvent`:

    ~~~haskell
    scheduleEvent :: Arg a => InstrRef a -> D -> D -> a -> SE ()
    scheduleEvent instrRed delayStartTime duration arguments
    ~~~

    It takes in instrument reference, start time from the time of invocation, duration (all in seconds) and miscellaneous arguments.
    Notice that the instrument reference is parametrized by the type of arguments. This way we can not feed the wrong messages to the instrument.

    Also we can create procedures that produce no output but do something useful:

    ~~~haskell
    newInstr :: Arg a => (a -> SE ()) -> SE (InstrRef a)
    ~~~


--------------------------------------

**The 5.1 is out! Let's warm up our hearts with new bright ideas in this Cold winter! New features:**

csound-expression


* **New data type for Patches!** This change is incompatible but it brings better support for playing patches live!
   The polyphonic and monophonic patches are united with single data-type so we can play them with the same functions.
   Also now we can create layered patches to play several patches at the same time and also we can split the keyboard
   on sections to play different patches on different sections. It's useful feature available in many modern synthesizers.
   But here we can include any number of layers! and we can mix mono and poly instruments together!

   See the [guide on patches](https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/Patches.md) to read the details.

* **Hard and soft sync**. Lots of functions added for hard and soft sync. Check out the module `Csound.Air.Wave.Sync`.

* **Morpheus is here**. New cool granular synthesizer is included. It's based on partikkel opcode.
   The aim is to simplify the work-flow with partikkel opcode. The API is experimental right now and might change.
   See the module `Csound.Air.Granular.Morpheus` for details.

* **Rewrite for filters**. Filters get new names that suppose the audio-quality of the filter. Also many filters were redesigned
   to unify the parameters (order of arguments and ranges). Check out the module `Csound.Air.Filter`.

* **Many great filters were added** thanks to the work of Steven Yi. Now we can use

   * zero-delay filters: `zlp`, `zhp`, `zbp`, `zladder`, `zdf2`, `zdf4`.

   * diode ladder filter (famous acid sound of TB-303): `diode`, `linDiode`

   * Korg 35 filters: `korg_lp`, `linKorg_lp`, `korg_hp`

   New classical analog-like filters:

   * Chebyshev type I and II low pass filters: lpCheb1, lpCheb2 (also there are high-pass versions)

   * new butterworth filters: `clp`

  Named filters with specific character suggested with a name: `plastic`, `wobble`, `trumpy`, `harsh`.

* **Transforming the audio with impulse responses now is super easy**. Check out the new functions `monoIR`, `stereoIR`
   from the module `Csound.Air.Fx`. With those functions we can easily add complicated and beautiful reverbs
   from natural environments or classical reverberation units. There are plenty IR resources you can find out on the WEB.
   Also it adds the cool `zconv` function for zero convolution delay kindly provided by Victor Lazzarini.

* **Cabbage support**. Adds full support for building [cabbage](http://cabbageaudio.com/) interfaces. Checkout the module `Csound.Cabbage`.
  We can create vst-plugins with it!  Still needs help for testing. We can check out the tutorial on how to build cabbage interfaces
  with csound-expression library: [Cabbage guide](https://github.com/spell-music/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/CabbageTutorial.md).

* **Useful aliases for classic reverbs** with single dry-wet ratio as a parameter: `room`, `chamber`, `hall`, `cave`.
  We can use it like this: `dac $ hall 0.25 mySynt` instead of `dec $ mixAt 0.25 largeHall2 mySynt`.

* **Raw waveforms for analogue-like oscillators**: `rawSaw`, `rawTri`, `rawSqr` non-band limited based
  on table lookup. Can be useful for LFOs or more light-weight versions of oscillators than `saw`, `tri` or `sqr`.

* **mul' new scaling function**. Scaling with side-effects. Can be useful to scale with random envelope.

* **Adds table read and write opcodes**. Adds opcodes `tablewa`, `tablew`, `readTab`, `readTable`, `readTable3`, `readTablei`.
    See the module `Csound.Tab` for details.

* **Convenient aliases for reading from audio-files to tables**. New names `wavLeft`, `wavRight`, `mp3Left`, `mp3Right` to read
   audio by channels. Also we can read both channels with functions `wavs` and `mp3s`.

* **Support for up to 8 outputs**. More instances for `RenderCsd` were added. Now we can play back up to 8 signals at the same time!

* **Useful option to suppress the event printing on the screen**. By default the Csound prints out every message on the screen (with time stamps and amplitudes).
    Now we have useful function `noTrace` to suppress those messages. Just write `dacBy noTrace $ mySigs` to stop them.

* **Adds More option setters for RT-audio engines**. New option setters: `setAlsa`, `setMme`, `setCoreAudio`.
    Also it fixes the name of the RT-engine for OSX.

csound-sampler

* **Adds randomized patterns** with which we can skip the beats in the fixed pattern by given probability: `rndPat` and `rndPat'`.

**The 5.0 is out! New features:**

csound-expression

* **Microtonal tunings**. We can use custom temperaments with insturments, patches, soundfonts and MIDI-instruments.
   Check out the guide on tuning and microtonal music (see also module `Csound.Tuning`).
   There are many predefined tunings (including ancient ones).
   Now we can play the authentic Bach music with Haskell!
   See [Custom temperament. Microtonal music](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/Tuning.md)
   for details.

* **Functions for Csound API**. We can interface with generated code through many other languages.
   We can generate the code with Haskell and the use it in other environments. we can build UI with Python or Clojure,
     we can create an Android synthesizer. See the guide section on Csound API.
     See [Csound API. Using generated code with another languages](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/CsoundAPI.md)
     for details.

* **Padsynth algorithm** (need Csound 6.05). There are functions that makes it easy to use wonderful PADsynth algorithm,
    This algorithm is designed to make "alive" instruments, natural pads.
    There are not only function that explore the algorithm but also new PAtches in the
    package csound-catalog that are based on it! See the section in the guide on the PADsynth.
    Lot's of padsynth instruments are mode with morphing support. We can crossfade between 2 or even 4 timbres.
    See [Padsynth algorithm](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/Padsynth.md)
    for details.

* **Argument modifiers** make it very convinient to modulate the rguments (apply vibrato to frequency
   or add some randomness to the parameter). See [Arguments modulation](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/ModArg.md)
   for details.

* The **hard clipping** was substituted with **limiter**. There should be no distortion when
   amplitude goes higher than `0dbfs` value.

* Adds **Ping-pong delay** implementation. See function `pingPong` at the module `Csound.Air.Fx`.

* Adds Rory Walsh's brand **new analog filters** (need Csound 6.07). See functions `alp1`, `alp2` and `alp3` at the module `Csound.Air.Filter`.

* Bugfixes for `mixAt` function. Now it doesn't duplicates the effectful-code.
   Now `mixAt` is not a function that is based on class `At`. It becomes
   a method in it's own class called `MixAt`. That fixes the code duplication problem.

csound-catalog

* **new instruments** that are based on **PADsynth algorithm**. Check out `Csound.Patch`
   at the section on PADsynth Sharc instruments. There are new deep spiritual vedic pads
   (vibhu, rishi, agni, prakriti, rajas, avatara, bhumi).
   See [Padsynth algorithm](https://github.com/anton-k/csound-expression/blob/master/tutorial/chapters/Padsynth.md)
    for details.


csound-sampler

* adds some useful instances for class `At` and `MixAt`.

**The 4.9.0 is out! New features:**

csound-expression

* Functions for creation of FM-synthesizers. We can create
the whole graph of FM-units (with feedback). Check out the module `Csound.Air.Fm`

* Support for Monosynth patches. See atMono in the module `Csound.Air.Patch`

* Easy to use Binaural panning. See the module `Csound.Air.Pan`

* Construction of patches for sound fonts (`sfPatch`, `sfPatchHall`).

* Table of tables. We can create a table that contains tables.

* Harmonic oscillators for subtractive synth: `buz` and `gbuz`

* Reverbs for patches. It's very easy to add a reverb to your  patch
 (`withSmallHall patch`, `withLargeHall patch`, etc)

* Some bug-fixes

csound-catalog

* Many mono-synth were added. You can use them with function `atMono`
  in place of `atMidi`. The mono versions of patches have suffix `m`.

* SHARC instruments. SHARC db contains a FFT-samples for sustain notes.
   It includes many orchestra instruments. There are many new patches that
   use natural sounding timbres taken from the SHARC library.
   Check out functions `soloSharc`, `padSharc`, `dreamSharc`.

csound-sampler

* Handy function `withBpm` allows to query current bpm with in the scope
  of expression.

* Sampler mappers were generalized.

* Char trigering functions are synchronized with bpm.

**The 4.8.3 is out! New features:**

This is a very important release to me.
It tries to solve the problem present in the most open source music-production libraries.
It's often the pack of beautiful sounds/timbres is missing. User is presented with
many audio primitives but no timbres are present to show the real power of the framework.
This release solves this problem. See the friend package csound-catalog on Hackage.
It defines 200+ beautiful instruments ready to be used.

The csound-expression defines a new type called `Patch` for description of an instrument
with  a chain of effects. It's good place to start the journey to the world of music production.

There are new functions for synchronized reaction on events. The triggering of events
can be synchronized with given BPM.

There examples are fixed and should work.

The library is updated for GHC-7.10!

**The 4.8.2 is out! New features:**

This release improves oscillators in many ways.
Adds phase control to many standard oscillators.
There are functions to detune oscillator and create unisions of oscillators
(multioscillators or chorus effect).

Adds support for randomly generating events (with random frequency).

**The 4.8 is out! New features:**

A multitap looper is implemented (see `Csound.Air.Looper`). It's  a powerful widget
with lots of controls. We can create unlimited number of taps.
And the length of the loops doesn't have to be the same for all taps.
We can insert effects and even external controllers. And all this is packed
as a simple function that produces a widget and the output signal.
Three types of loopers are available one is for raw signal inputs,
another for midi instruments and the last one is for soundfonts.
You can see it in action at [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQQt9bu_x-A).

There are lots of new step sequencers available.
Pre 4.8 step sequencers could only produce signals
with equal time segments but new step sequencers can
play a tiny melodies. The API of temporal-media is
supported for step sequencers (see `Csound.Air.Envelope`).
There is a new type called `Seq`. It's for step sequencers
that can play monophonic melodies.

There is a type class for humanization of envelopes.
It works for linseg and step sequencers. It adds some amount
of randomness to durations or values (see `Csound.Air.Envelope` `HumanValue`
and `HumanTime`).

A midi chooser ui-box was implemented (see `Csound.Air.Live`, `hmidiChooser`, `uiMidi`).
It makes it easy to choose a midi instrument among several alternatives. There are stand alone
widgets and widgets implemented as an effect-box.

The class `Compose` from `temporal-media` package was broken
to two classes: `Harmony` (with function `hor`)
and `Melody` (with function `mel`).

**The 4.7 is out! New features:**

The Scores are redesigned! The low level `CsdEventList` is substituted
with more advanced and flexible type `Sco`. The instruments are triggered not
with pairs or triplets (individual events) but with scores!

The lib now depends on common APIs for delaying and composing values.
There are common type classes for composition.

There is a simple API for composition of samples, notes and signal segments.
The `mel` plays units sequentially, The `hor` plays units at the same time.
The `del` delays the unit by given amount of time, The `lim` limits the unit in time.
the `loop` creates infinite loops. The `loopBy` creates finite loops.
The list of all functions can be found in the package temporal-media. See
the module `Temporal.Class`.

I need to update the guide for changes!

**The 4.6 is out! New features:**

* Granular delays and effects (see `Csound.Air.Granular`)

* It's possible to create tables not only for reading but also for writing.
  We can create sound buffers (see `newTab` and `newGlobalTab` in the module `Csound.Tab`).

* Hyper Vectorial Synthesis (HVS). Easy to use functions for HVS (see `Csound.Air.Hvs`)
   With HVS we can control lots of parameters with a couple of sliders.
   The HVS can reduce the size of control parameters by interpolating between snapshots of parameters.

* New spectral functions for spectral fusion: `crossSpecFilter` and `crossSpecVocoder` (see `Csound.Air.Spec`)

* New effect for playing input samples in segments (back and forth) `trackerSplice`
  (original design by Rory Walsh). With it we can extract segments of live audio and
  repeat them or play in reverse.

**The 4.5 is out! New features:**

* Easy to use granular synthesis (see `Csound.Air.Granular`)

* Support for opcode `mincer`. It's possible to scale pitch and tempo
  of audio files independently (see `Csound.Air.Wav` ram reading functions).

**The 4.4 is out! New features:**

* Signal segments.  With signal segments we can schedule audio signals
    with event streams. We can limit audio signals with clicks of the buttons
    or some other live events. We can retrigger samples, play them in sequence and
    perform many more actions shich are tied to the event streams.

* Triggering samples with keyboard and midi-events (see `Csound.Air.Sampler`).
